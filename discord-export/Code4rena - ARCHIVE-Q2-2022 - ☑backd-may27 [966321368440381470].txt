When I run `brownie test` I see this:

```
ImportError: Error importing plugin "fixtures.deployments": cannot import name 'Literal' from 'typing' (/usr/local/Cellar/python@3.7/3.7.10_2/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/typing.py)
```

Any idea why?


[04/21/2022 5:21 AM] 100proof
Hmm, looks like I might need to upgrade to python3.8


[04/21/2022 5:33 AM] 100proof
Yes, that was the problem. Upgrade to python3.8 if you see the same problem.

Also, I had some trouble with `ganache` not loading properly when running `brownie test` .

It turns out that you need to run `npm install -g ganache@alpha` to install `ganache v7.0.0-alpha.2`

Hi there!
I'm Daniel, one of the cofounder of Backd. 
I'm looking forward to your feedback! Let me know if you have any questions!


[04/21/2022 7:36 AM] danhper
The latest version of ganache (not alpha) should work too!


[04/21/2022 3:09 PM] bernd_42
I'm on Mac OS Silicon (M1) using python@3.9.1 and installing all requirements lead to following error:

```
filename = fspath(filename)  # Does type-checking of `filename`
TypeError: expected str, bytes or os.PathLike object, not int
  ----------------------------------------
  ERROR: Failed building wheel for pyyaml  
```

Anyone else having similar issues?


[04/21/2022 3:43 PM] bernd_42
Got it working with python@3.8.6. Running `brownie test` or `brownie compile` caused an error with vyper. Can be fixed with https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70331345/eth-brownie-installation-error-tried-all-3-methods-linux

Hey Backd team, am I correct in thinking that all in-scope contracts have already been deployed? Or maybe all except those related to topup action?


[04/22/2022 9:41 AM] samwern#8094
Hey @Django | Saloon Finance, yes, you are correct. Those related to the top up action have not been deployed. Also the strategies have been deployed, but the in-scope strategy contracts contain some improvements/modifications (which have not been deployed).

Could someone explain to me what functions `prepareAddress`, `resetAddress` and `executeAddress` in contract `AddressProvider` are all about? Please provide as much detail as possible since I'm new to smart contract auditing and am trying to learn common patterns.


[04/23/2022 7:52 AM] chase_manning
The Address Provider stores contract addresses to be used by the rest of the protocol.


[04/23/2022 7:53 AM] chase_manning
For example, if somewhere in the Backd Protocol, we wanted to use some Oracle. Instead of hard coding that address in several other Backd contracts, we could store it in the Address Provider, and query it from there.


[04/23/2022 7:54 AM] chase_manning
The benefit of storing key addresses in the Address Provider, is that the address is not duplicated in lots of places. So we have a centralised way of managing these addresses. For example, if we wanted to update an address, we would just have to do it in one place instead of many.


[04/23/2022 7:55 AM] chase_manning
This pattern of `prepare`, `reset` and `execute` is quite common. It is a security measure to limit the ability for the Admin to execute a malicious action.


[04/23/2022 7:56 AM] chase_manning
If the addresses could be updated directly and immediately by the Admin, then the admin could potentially drain funds from the protocol by changing a critical address to something malicious.


[04/23/2022 7:56 AM] chase_manning
Instead, the admin must first `prepare` an address update. This preparation is visible to anyone and allows users to make sure that the change is safe for the protocol.


[04/23/2022 7:57 AM] chase_manning
There is a delay period before a `prepared` change can be executed. Allowing enough time for the community to review the change. And to withdraw their funds if they view the change as undesirable.


[04/23/2022 7:57 AM] chase_manning
Once the delay has passed, the prepared change can be `executed` which will make it live


[04/23/2022 7:59 AM] chase_manning
This pattern is often called a Timelock.


[04/23/2022 7:59 AM] chase_manning
You can read more about it and see some common code examples here: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/tree/6c1a6340539be1967e63158fb9f997ef62d47f70/contracts/governance

thankyou (2) 

[04/23/2022 9:48 PM] 100proof
Thank you @Chase. I was able to piece together the intention of the functions by reading some more code but it's always nice to get such a clear answer from someone to confirm. Thanks for taking the time to explain that in so much detail.


[04/24/2022 12:33 AM] 100proof
Why is the type of address in `TopUpAction.register`  `bytes32` and not just `address`? The documentation states "first 20 bytes will typically be the address". Is there any meaning assigned to the remaining 12 bytes?


[04/24/2022 7:25 AM] chase_manning
Most Lending protocols index a users topup via their address, in which case an `address` type would work well for this (which is what we had it as in a previous version of the code). However, when integrating the TopupUpAction with some other lending protocols, we discovered that some of them index a users topup with a `bytes32` type. We decided to change to using `bytes32` type so that we can support more lending protocols. For protocols that use `address` to index, the other 12 bites go unused.

[04/24/2022 8:10 PM] 0xdjango
Hi, I'm having trouble tracking down the base contract where variables such as this are set. `currentUInts256[_KEEPER_FEE_FRACTION_KEY]`


[04/24/2022 11:05 PM] 100proof
@Django | Saloon Finance is it `contracts/utils/Preparable.sol`?


[04/24/2022 11:06 PM] 100proof
Any idea why those other protocols use `bytes32`?


[04/24/2022 11:06 PM] 0xdjango
Yes thanks!


[04/25/2022 5:09 AM] Deleted User
Probably because in some rust chains address can be longer than 20 bytes. For example btc address is 32+1 = 33 bytes.
Probably this allows to extend contract to other chains having address size <= 32 bytes.


[04/25/2022 7:08 AM] chase_manning
`_KEEPER_FEE_FRACTION_KEY` is set in the `TopUpActionFeeHandler` using the `Preparable` contract it extends from.

{Reactions}
üëç 

[04/25/2022 7:09 AM] chase_manning
No sorry I'm not sure why they use `bytes32`


[04/25/2022 12:17 PM] danhper
As far as I know, some protocols allow a single address to have multiple positions, so the first 20 bytes are the address and the other 12 bytes are used as an identifier for this address.

Are y'all sticking solely to Ethereum or planning to branch out to other chains?


[04/25/2022 1:42 PM] chase_manning

It's likely we will support other chains in future.

What does it mean for the pool and vault allocations to be correctly balanced? Trying to understand the purpose of _rebalanceVault() in the EthPool/ERC20Pool


[04/26/2022 6:34 AM] chase_manning
To optimise on gas, not all of the underlying is deposited into the strategy. Instead, a buffer is stored in the Vault of idle underlying. This is used to facilitate low gas deposits and withdrawals.


[04/26/2022 6:35 AM] chase_manning
When this buffer of idle funds gets too far away from the target allocation, a rebalance is done to bring the idle amount back in line with the target.


[04/26/2022 6:37 AM] chase_manning
The general effect of this, is that small or medium deposits or withdrawals will usually be cheap on gas, as they do not require a full deposit into the strategy. And larger deposits or withdrawals (which would imbalance the idle ratio) would trigger a full deposit or withdrawal from the strategy.

Are keepers and whether they report the correct amount of top ups in or out of scope?


[05/28/2022 3:58 PM] scaraven
and with the interest given out, would a fixed amount be distributed by the inflation manager and allocated proportionally to the 3 different parts (LP provider, keeper and AMM LPs) and *then* the interest allocated to any given address will be calculated by the 3 respective parts?


[05/29/2022 9:27 AM] chase_manning

Just a quick additional question on scope. 

I was looking in the code4arena repo with all of the code from the code base and was curious is all contracts in the `contracts` dir are in scope for security/optimizations?

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/tree/main/protocol/contracts

or are there some that are out of scope in here


[05/31/2022 8:42 AM] chase_manning
The only contracts that are in scope are the ones listed here:
